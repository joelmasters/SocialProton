## What is Social Proton?
Social Proton is the foundation for a network of positive social influences. Positive social influences are ones that uphold moral values and are viewed to be "good" influences on a younger person's life. The determination is entirely subjective, but rooted deep in Christian values. Values include: selflessness, responsibility, positivity, care of others, self-control, and patience. In addition, the influencers must also want to do good.

## Why Social Proton?
Social Proton is conceived from my heart for young online gamers. When I was one, I found the community (whether in-game or streamers) to be largely filled with manifestations of low self-esteem in the form of uncontrolled anger ("rage"), selfishness, lack of patience, and devoid of a care for others, many being described as "toxic" environments. Young people often seek asylum from the "real world" within games, where they feel they can make a difference and be accepted. What if the gaming community, rather than being "toxic", were a place where young people would feel empowered, built up, and supported, even finding a real sense of community, rather than feeling conditional acceptance. 

Social Proton aims to recognize and partner with influencers that fit the role of a positive social influence. We plan to provide training, resources, tools, counseling, and other help to build up these leaders in the community, just like we do in the church.

## Mission Statement
Connect youth with positive social influences.

## Plan of Attack
The phase I plan (project name: Proton Gamer) will be to identify positive streamers within the gaming community and help strengthen their impact. Impact could be the number of followers (width), or more engagement with existing followers (depth). We will provide coaching for improving their stream quality and popularity, as well as tools (screen recording software, audio software, cameras, microphones, green screens).

The very first step will be to reach out to streamers that already have good quality equipment, and would essentially be willing to partner with us without any real changes.

### Increase Width
We can increase width by promoting the streamer through typical marketing techniques:
- blog posts targeted to parents (impacts of role models on youth, time a typical youth spends watching streams)
- blog posts targeted to gamers (tips for improving play, interviews, life of a gamer)
- social media promotions
- interviews with streamer

### Increase Depth
We can increase depth by providing the streamer with tools to drive stream engagement such as:
- giveaways (small prizes go a long way with youth)
- moderators 
- chat bots
- questions for the streamer to ask
- educational resources
- ways to get in contact off stream

## Knowledge Gaps
1. I have no idea how to run a successful stream. I can understand, as a viewer, a good stream from a bad one, but I will need to dig into the science behind what makes a stream great.
