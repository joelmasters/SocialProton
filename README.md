## What is Social Proton?
Social Proton is the foundation for a network of positive social influences. Positive social influences are ones that uphold moral values and are viewed to be "good" influences on a younger person's life. The determination is entirely subjective, but rooted deep in Christian values. Values include: selflessness, responsibility, positivity, care of others, self-control, and patience. In addition, the influencers must also want to do good.

## Why Social Proton?
Social Proton is conceived from my heart for young online gamers. When I was one, I found the community (whether in-game or streamers) to be largely filled with manifestations of low self-esteem in the form of uncontrolled anger ("rage"), selfishness, lack of patience, and devoid of a care for others, many being described as "toxic" environments. Young people often seek asylum from the "real world" within games, where they feel they can make a difference and be accepted. What if the gaming community, rather than being "toxic", were a place where young people would feel empowered, built up, and supported, even finding a real sense of community, real friends who care about each other, rather than feeling conditional acceptance. 

Social Proton aims to recognize and partner with positive social influencers. We plan to provide training, resources, tools, counseling, and other resources help to build up these leaders in the community, just like we do in the church.

## Mission Statement
Connect youth with positive social influences.

## Plan of Attack
The phase I plan (project name: Proton Gamer) will be to identify positive streamers within the gaming community and help strengthen their impact. Impact could be the number of followers (width), or more engagement with existing followers (depth). We will provide coaching for improving their stream quality and popularity, as well as tools (screen recording software, audio software, cameras, microphones, green screens).

The very first step will be to reach out to streamers that already have good quality equipment, and would essentially be willing to partner with us without any real changes.

### Increase Width
We can increase width by promoting the streamer through typical marketing techniques:
- blog posts targeted to parents (impacts of role models on youth, time a typical youth spends watching streams, influence of video games on youth - positive and negative)
- blog posts targeted to gamers (tips for improving play, interviews, life of a gamer)
- social media promotions (ads, giveaways)
- interviews with streamer

### Increase Depth
We can increase depth by providing the streamer with tools to drive stream engagement such as:
- giveaways (small or large)
- moderators 
- chat/trivia bots
- questions for the streamer to ask
- educational resources
- ways to get in contact off stream
- breakouts/ways to break chat into multiple groups
- memorable icons for participants

## Knowledge Gaps
1. I have no idea how to run a successful stream. I can understand, as a viewer, a good stream from a bad one, but I will need to dig into the science behind what makes a stream great.
2. How to build (online) community. Ideally, each stream would be its own welcoming community.

# Phase I Actions
1. Identify the game with the largest streaming viewership on Twitch
2. Identify a streamer with a good community of followers already
    1. Regular streaming schedule
    2. Greater than 100 viewers consistently
    3. Active particpants
    4. Mostly positive
3. Reach out to streamer for partnership
4. Experiment with ways to build up streamer's community
    1. Positive chat -- lead by example
    2. How-to questions (how do I do this in the game? What is better, this or that? Why did he/she do that?) -- give community opportunities to be good
    3. Greet new sign-ons
5. Determine worthwhile metrics to measure against
    1. Number of viewers
    2. Amount of chat overall (number of lines, % viewers)
    3. Positive vs. Negative chat sentiment
    4. Amount of vulnerabilities (could be as simple as others asking questions they don't know the answers to)
6. Iteratate
    1. What worked?
    2. What didn't work or had little impact?
    3. What needs to be added?
