## What is SocialProton?
Social Proton is the foundation for a network of positive social influences. Positive social influences are ones that uphold moral values and are viewed to be "good" influences on a younger person's life. The determination is entirely subjective, but rooted deep in Christian values. Values include: selflessness, responsibility, positivity, care of others, self-control, and patience, among others. In addition, the influencers must also want to do good.

Social Proton is conceived from my heart for young online gamers. When I was one, I found the community (whether in-game or streamers) to be largely filled with manifestations of low self-esteem in the form of uncontrolled anger ("rage"), selfishness, lack of patience, and devoid of a care for others, many being described as "toxic" environments. Young people often seek asylum from the "real world" within games, where they feel they can make a difference and be accepted. What if the gaming community, rather than being "toxic", were a place where young people would feel empowered, built up, and supported, even finding a real sense of community, rather than feeling conditional acceptance. 

Social Proton aims to recognize and partner with influencers that fit the role of a positive social influence. We plan to provide training, resources, tools, counseling, and other help to build up these leaders in the community, just like we do in the church.

## Mission Statement
Connect youth with social influences that will positivelay shape the next generation.

## Plan of Attack
The phase I plan will be to identify positive streamers within the gaming community and help strengthen their impact. Impact could be the number of followers (width), or more engagement with existing followers (depth).

To increase width, we can write blog posts, social media promotions, and other marketing techniques.

To increase depth, we can provide the streamer with tools to drive stream engagement such as giveaways, moderators, chat bots, questions for the streamer to ask, educational resources, ways to get in contact off stream, among other resources.
